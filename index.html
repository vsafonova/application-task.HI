                    <h3 class="lead">
                        With the rise of users on Instagram, the platform has become a breeding ground for unrealistic and unreachable beauty standards
                        that negatively impact individuals' and society's mental health, self-esteem, and body image.
                    </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Users with an appearance that often consists of the same elements receive more likes on social networks: 
                        smooth matte skin tone without problem areas and visible pores, a small, narrow nose, high cheekbones, and a defined jawline.
                        A taut hourglass figure with pronounced abs and voluminous breasts and buttocks. Long shiny hair, tanned skin, 
                        and naturally toned makeup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve wide recognition on Instagram, people use various face filters to hide skin problems and visible wide pores and use photoshop
                        to make the waist look narrower and the chest bigger to fit this "beautiful" picture on Instagram.
                        But all this devalues  our unique appearance features and leads to dissatisfaction with our appearance in real life.

                    <h2>
                        How to solve these problems?
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        Instagram could introduce several digital features and changes to its app.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Instagram should take responsibility and implement measures to regulate content that promotes unrealistic
                        beauty standards. They can do this by developing and enforcing policies that ban filters and photo-editing tools
                        that promote unrealistic beauty standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, Instagram can highlight and promote diverse and inclusive beauty standards by showcasing individuals
                        with different body types, skin tones, and features in the recommendation feed. This involves developing
                        algorithms prioritizing diverse content and partnering with influencers and creators promoting body positivity
                        and inclusivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, Instagram can allow viewers to disable filters to see the original content.
                        This will enable users to view content in its original form and promote transparency and authenticity on the platform.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        To introduce these changes on Instagram into society,
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        Instagram could work with mental health experts, activists, and influencers to create and promote the abovementioned features.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Instagram should communicate the changes to its users through various channels, such as in-app notifications, blog posts,
                        and social media. It will help build awareness and understanding of the changes and promote positive community reception.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        Possible challenges with implementing these digital solutions 
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        Many users who are used to using filters and photoshop will start to resist the changes. 
                        Especially who don't recognize that this problem has a high value. People can begin feeling anxious
                        when they want to post stories, reels, or posts.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        And these changes and features will hurt advertisers, 
                        who will lose the possibility of promoting unrealistic beauty standards, and Instagram will start to lose money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And it will also be more difficult for some bloggers to promote themselves on Instagram by creating filters for a more "beautiful" face.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        Who will benefit from the proposed solution?
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        In this proposed solution, the beneficiaries would be individuals who use Instagram
                        and are impacted by the unrealistic beauty standards promoted on the platform. 
                        This includes people of all ages and genders who may struggle with body image issues, self-esteem, and mental health
                        concerns due to exposure to unrealistic beauty standards on Instagram.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The first solution would benefit these individuals by reducing the prevalence of content that promotes 
                        unrealistic beauty standards. By banning filters and photo-editing tools that promote these standards, 
                        Instagram can help to create a more authentic and realistic representation of beauty on the platform, 
                        which can help to alleviate the pressure and anxiety that users may experience when comparing themselves 
                        to these unrealistic standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second solution would benefit these individuals by promoting the platform's diverse and inclusive beauty standards. 
                        By showcasing individuals with different body types, skin tones, and features in the recommendation feed, 
                        Instagram can help to promote a more inclusive and accepting definition of beauty. 
                        This can help to create a more positive and empowering environment for users who may feel marginalized 
                        or excluded by traditional beauty standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third solution would benefit these individuals by allowing them to view content in its original form. 
                        By allowing users to disable filters and see the original content, 
                        Instagram can help to promote transparency and authenticity on the platform. 
                        This can help to reduce the prevalence of unrealistic beauty standards and promote a more positive 
                        and empowering environment for users.
